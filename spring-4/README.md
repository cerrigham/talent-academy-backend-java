## REST with Spring MVC

A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. <br/>
That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.
