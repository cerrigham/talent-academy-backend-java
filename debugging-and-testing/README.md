# Debugging and Testing

## Testing with JUnit

JUnit is the most widely used testing framework for Java.
Learn [how to write tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-for-absolute-beginners-c/learn/lecture/9604940) for your Java code.

**Attention**
> The video talks about JUnit 4, now we are using JUnit 5.
> Learn the basic concepts because they are the same.
> 
> For more information about JUnit 5, please take a look at the [official guide](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/).
> 
> Always remember that your **Mentor** will be ready for clarify tour doubts.

[Here](src/test/java/test/SimpleTest.java) you can find a simple test.
From now on we can expect to write tests instead on `main(...)`.
