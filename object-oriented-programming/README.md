# Object-Oriented Programming

---

## Classes and Objects

It's time to earn the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.

Take some time to learn what [classes](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/137826) are.
Objects are created from classes that acts as a template for those objects.
Classes contain data, [methods](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/139565), [constructors](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/13976).

It's a complex topic, consider also [this](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-object-oriented-java-u) as a reference.

## Access, Encapsulation, and Static Methods

Each element (classes, methods, constructors, etc.) explained before can be accessed from every part of the software, or it can have some restrictions.
Learn [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/java-access-encapsulation-and-static-methods) how to use effectively access modifiers.

## Inheritance and Polymorphism

Classes can be related with other classes with a inheritance relationship.
Learn [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/147402) how inheritance works.
After you understand how inheritance works, you can learn [polymorphism](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/149501), one of the three concepts of OOP..

Again, it's a complex topic. Consider [this](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-inheritance-and-polymorphism-java-u) as a reference.

## Generics   

The last topic of this part, and a prerequisite for understanding the Collection Framework, is the Generics concept.
Learn [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/152306) how to use this powerful feature.
