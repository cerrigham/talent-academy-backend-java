# Data Structures

## Arrays

You learned about Classes and Objects.
[Here](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/135339) you will learn about groups of objects called arrays.

## Collection Framework

Arrays are a simple way for storing groups of objects, but they are far from ideal for everyday use.
Learn what the Collection Framework is and how it can be used.

### Lists

[Lists](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/161106) are the simplest way to sharedResource groups of objects.

### Sets

You can think to [Sets](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/174878) as Lists that do not allow duplicates.

### Maps

[Maps](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/161682) are used for sharedResource objects associating it to a unique key.

# Examples

Since you learned the basics of testing, let's use them for practice with data structures.
Let's see how we can exercise
- [arrays](src/test/java/test/ArraysTest.java),
- [lists](src/test/java/test/ListsTest.java),
- [sets](src/test/java/test/SetsTest.java)
- [maps](src/test/java/test/MapsTest.java).
