# Data Structures

## Arrays

Yoy learned about Classes and Objects.
[Here](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/135339) you will learn about groups of objects called arrays.

## Collection Framework

Arrays are a simple way for storing groups of objects, but they are far from ideal for everyday use.
Learn what the Collection Framework is and how it can be used.

### Lists

[Lists](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/161106) are the simplest way to store groups of objects.

### Sets

You can think to [Sets](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/174878) as Lists that do not allow duplicates.

### Maps

[Maps](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/161682) are used for store objects associating it to a unique key.
