Look [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-jdbc) to learn about it.

## JPA

JPA is just a specification that facilitates object-relational mapping to manage relational data in Java applications. It provides a platform to work directly with objects instead of using SQL statements.

# Examples

Let's see some examples:

- [JDBC connection and query](src/main/java/TutorialJdbc.java),
- [JPA connections](src/test/java/test/StreamsTest.java),
