# Fundamentals

## Relational database intro

Take a look [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/131409) and [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-for-absolute-beginners-c/learn/lecture/9604718) for learning about variables and primitive data types.

And [here](src/main/java/it/bitrock/academy/VariablesAndPrimitiveTypes.java) you can find some examples.

## Table

Variables can be used in different ways. [Here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-variables), you can learn how operators can be used.

[Here](src/main/java/it/bitrock/academy/Operators.java) you can find some examples and questions for test your understanding.

## Query

You will work with text every day. Learn [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/131416) how to use it.

Check [here](src/main/java/it/bitrock/academy/Strings.java) your understanding about strings.

## insert/update/delete

Learn [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-conditionals-control-flow-u) the basics of handling conditions within your code.

Let's see some [examples](src/main/java/it/bitrock/academy/ControlStatements.java).

## select

Sometimes you will need to do the same thing for multiple times.
Learn [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-loops) how Java allows you to do that.

## join

Sometimes you will need to do the same thing for multiple times.
Learn [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-loops) how Java allows you to do that.

## where

Sometimes you will need to do the same thing for multiple times.
Learn [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-loops) how Java allows you to do that.

## order by

Sometimes you will need to do the same thing for multiple times.
Learn [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-loops) how Java allows you to do that.

## group by

Sometimes you will need to do the same thing for multiple times.
Learn [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-loops) how Java allows you to do that.

At last, some examples again [here](src/main/java/it/bitrock/academy/Loops.java).
