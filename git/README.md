# GIT

## What is a VCS

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. <br/>
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.  <br/>
As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. <br/><br/>
Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.  <br/>
If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. <br/>

## GIT

Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.  <br/>
A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source.  <br/>
Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). <br/></br>
