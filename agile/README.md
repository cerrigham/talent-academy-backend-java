## What is Agile

### Manifesto for Agile Software Development

[We](https://agilemanifesto.org/) are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. <br/>
Through this work we have come to value:<br/>
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br/>
Working software over comprehensive documentation<br/>
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br/>
Responding to change over following a plan<br/><br/>

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.<br/>

### Agile methodologies 

There are many Agile methodologies (scrum, kanban, extreme programming), we'll take a look to Scrum

## Scrum

[Scrum](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. <br/>
In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where: <br/>
 - a Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog
 - the Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint
 - the Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint
 - repeat

### Scrum values

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: <br/>
Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage. <br/>

The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems. <br/>

These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior. The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them. The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.
