# Spring Part 2

## Annotation-based Dependency Injection

In Spring Framework annotations related to dependency injection are, namely 
 - @Resource
 - @Inject
 - @Autowired

Look [here](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-annotations-resource-inject-autowire) to learn about them.

## Spring Boot

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". <br/>
We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration. <br/><br/>
Features:
 - create stand-alone Spring applications
 - embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
 - provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
 - automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
 - provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
 - absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
<br/>
