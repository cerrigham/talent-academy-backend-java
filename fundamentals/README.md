# Fundamentals

## Variables & Primitive Types

Take a look [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/131409) and [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-for-absolute-beginners-c/learn/lecture/9604718) for learning about variables and primitive data types.

## Operators

Variables can be used in different ways. [Here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-variables), you can learn how operators can be used.

## Strings

You will work with text every day. Learn [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/131416) how to use it.

## Conditionals and Control Flow

Learn [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-conditionals-control-flow-u) the basics of handling conditions within your code.

## Loops

Sometimes you will need to do the same thing for multiple times.
Learn [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java/modules/learn-java-loops) how Java allows you to do that.
