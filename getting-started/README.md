# Getting Started

## Introduction to the Java World

Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are based on the C and C++ languages, <br/>
The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office (Sun Microsystems). Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.<br/>

### Principles
There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:
 - it must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar
 - it must be robust and secure
 - it must be architecture-neutral and portable
 - it must execute with high performance
 - it must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic

### Execution system
Portability means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support. This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. <br/>
Java uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle. <br/>

## JDK setup

Do one of the following.

### Open JDK

Go [here](https://jdk.java.net/18/) to download Open JDK version 18. 

### Oracle JDK

Go [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads) to download the JDK for your environment.

### SDKMAN (only for Unix/Linux/MacOS)

Go [here](https://sdkman.io/install) and follow the instructions to install SDKMAN!.

Then, run `sdk install java` to install the latest version of Java.

### Env variabile

Set environment variable for Java on your system, at the end open a shell console and type java command.

## IDE setup

### IntelliJ IDEA

Go [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) to download and then install the latest version of the Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA.

As an alternative, download and install the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app) and then install IntelliJ IDEA using the Toolbox App.

## Hello, Java!

Go [here](src/main/java/it/bitrock/academy/HelloJava.java), and you will find the simplest Java application.
Try to run it using your IDE.

## Maven

Go [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) to download Maven on your machine, also set env variable. 

## Git

Go [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download Git on your machine.
