# Maven

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects (it can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages). 
The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation, where it was formerly part of the Jakarta Project.

Maven addresses two aspects of building software: how software is built, and its dependencies. 
Maven dynamically downloads Java libraries and Maven plug-ins from one or more repositories such as the Maven 2 Central Repository, and stores them in a local cache.
Let's try to understand its basics [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/maven-quick-start/).
