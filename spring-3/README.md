# Spring Part 3

## Spring Data (transactions management)

Spring Data is a high level SpringSource project whose purpose is to unify and ease the access to different kinds of persistence stores, both relational database systems and NoSQL data stores. <br/><br/>
Hibernate is a JPA provider and ORM that maps Java objects to relational database tables. Spring Data JPA is an abstraction that makes working with the JPA provider less verbose. Using Spring Data JPA you can eliminate a lot of the boilerplate code involved in managing a JPA provider like Hibernate. <br>
